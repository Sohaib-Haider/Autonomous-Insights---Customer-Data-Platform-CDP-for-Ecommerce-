## Overview
CDP focused only on ecommerce. Lets an ecommerce store connect their customer data, get ML/rule-based customer segmentation, KPIs, a Customer 360 view, and run multi-channel campaigns (email/SMS/WhatsApp) via a drag-and-drop workflow builder.

## Data Foundation
- 7 raw Kaggle ecommerce datasets, pairwise merged/transformed into 9 (or 10, TBD) clean per-segment training datasets, all normalized to look like one ecommerce store's data
- ML models trained per segment that requires one (some segments are rule-based, no ML)
- Each segment has a fixed `required_fields` schema (config-driven, not hardcoded) — a segment only becomes available to a store if their ingested data satisfies its schema

## Segments (9–10, list TBD, examples)
Purchase Intent, Future High-Value/CLV, Discount Responsive, Churn-Risk, Channel Preference, Replenishment-Ready, Cross-Sell Opportunity, Seasonal Purchase, Cart Abandoners

## Ingestion
Two options: CSV upload, or connect their own Postgres DB (read-only source). Both paths converge into the same in-memory pandas pipeline — no per-source branching logic.

## Column Mapping
Claude API (LLM) maps the store's arbitrary column names to the platform's required schema fields (e.g. "petrol average" → "fuel_mileage").

## Cleaning & Storage
Data is cleaned/transformed in-memory (pandas), then persisted once into the platform's own internal multi-tenant Postgres DB. The platform does NOT write back to the store's connected database — their DB is read-only input.

## Segmentation & KPIs
After mapping, check which segments the store's fields satisfy → run those segments (ML or rule-based) → save results to `customer_segments` table. KPIs computed the same way (from raw + ML outputs) → `customer_kpis` table. Customer 360 view = a joined view over customer + segments + KPIs, not separately stored raw data.

## Campaigns
User picks a segment (or custom filter) → builds a workflow with drag-and-drop nodes: send-message (with variables like {{customer_name}}), wait/delay, channel-select (WhatsApp / SMS / email only).

## Platform Users
Separate `users` app for the ecommerce store's own account: signup/login/store profile. Distinct from the ingested end-customer data.

## Tech Stack
Backend: Django + DRF (Python chosen for ML/data ecosystem — pandas/sklearn are C-backed, not a performance bottleneck for this use case)
DB: PostgreSQL
LLM: Gemini flash free API
Frontend: TBD, will consume backend via REST APIs

## Folder Structure
Include the backend folder structure (apps split by domain: customers, segments, campaigns, analytics, users; config/, core/, ml_models/), and leave frontend/ as an empty placeholder folder for now.

## Status / Open Decisions
Note as open/unconfirmed: exact segment count (9 vs 10), whether workflow builder needs more node types, exact KPI list.

Write it in clean developer-README style — headers, short bullets, code blocks for structure/stack — no fluff, no marketing tone.
